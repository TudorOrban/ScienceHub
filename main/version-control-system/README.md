We have developed a custom version control system (VCS) for the website, designed to:
- be easily usable by non-programmers
- encourage intercommunity collaboration
- support incremental development of scientific research
- hit the right middle ground between storage and computational efficiency, given our current resources and the needs of the website.

We are currently in the process of moving most of the logic to the backend, see [to be added](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ScienceHub/tree/main/sciencehub-backend/sciencehub-backend/Features/Submissions/README.md).
