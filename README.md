# ScienceHub
ScienceHub is a platform aiming to provide software solutions to facilitate the scientific process.

# Features
There are three main categories of features: **Research**, **Management** and **Community**.

### Research
**Works** are the basic blocks of scientific research. They can be **Papers**, **Experiments**, **Datasets**, **Data Analyses**, **AI Models** or **Code Blocks**, and can be organized into **Projects** fo

### Management
Projects and works are updated through a custom [version control system](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ScienceHub/blob/main/version-control-system/README.md) built from scratch to accommodate the needs of the website and encourage intercommunity collaboration. **Submissions**, akin to git commits, are blocks holding changes between project or work versions. There are also **Issues** and (Community) **Reviews**.

### Community
This includes real-time **Discussions** and **Chats**, as well as **Team** management.

These features show up throughout the main page directories:
-**Workspace**: A comprehensive space through which the user can manage their work.
-**Browse**: A unified space for browsing ScienceHub data.
-Other: **Profile** pages, **Project** pages, **Resources**
